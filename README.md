# aws-simple-dynamodb-client

This libary is for providing convinence with the developers to write code for operation of AMAZON Dyanmodb.
Generally, most of developer has been using AWS DynamoD Document Client, I reckon it is fully enough to write code with business code.
However, sometiems I felt it was incovenience when wrtting the query with filter conditions and trasaction write.
